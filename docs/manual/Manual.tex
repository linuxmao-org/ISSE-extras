\section{About}
ISSE is an interactive sound source separation editor.  It allows you to  import a single audio recording and separate it into two distinct sound sources via drawing and painting tools.  Example tasks include separating a cell  phone ring from recorded speech, separating drums mixed with bass guitar,  or separating vocals from background music. See our demo \textcolor{blue}{\href{http://isse.sourceforge.net/index.html}{video}} for more  information.

The software is an open source, freely available, cross platform audio editing tool developed by the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA), Stanford University and Adobe Research. It is licensed under the GNU General Public License, Version 3. Authors include: \textcolor{blue}{\href{http://ccrma.stanford.edu/~njb}{Nicholas J. Bryan}}, \textcolor{blue}{\href{http://ccrma.stanford.edu/~gautham}{Gautham J. Mysore}}, and  \textcolor{blue}{\href{http://ccrma.stanford.edu/~ge}{Ge Wang}}.

\section{Installation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{OSX}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Download the latest version at  \textcolor{blue}{\href{http://isse.sourceforge.net/download.html}{isse.sourceforge.net/download.html}}
\item Double-click the ISSE.dmg file. This will open the ISSE disk image.
\item Click-and-drag the ISSE application into your Applications folder.
\item (Optional) Copy the additional materials (test files, manual, etc.).
\item Done!  
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Windows}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Download the latest version at  \textcolor{blue}{\href{http://isse.sourceforge.net/download.html}{isse.sourceforge.net/download.html}}
\item Double-click the ISSE-Setup.exe file. This will open the ISSE installer.
\item Following the installation steps.
\item Note, additional materials (test files, manual, etc.) are also installed along with the application.
\item Done!  
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Linux}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Download the latest version of the code at  \textcolor{blue}{\href{http://sourceforge.net/p/isse/code/ci/master/tree/}{sourceforge.net/p/isse/code/ci/master/tree/}}
\item Following the compilation steps from at \textcolor{blue}{\href{http://isse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Developer}{isse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Developer}}.
\item Compile as needed per platform....
\item Done! 
\item Note: we will eventually support installation packages, but at this time only the source code (tested on Fedora) is available.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Quick Start}

\begin{enumerate}
\item For a quick introduction to the application, please see the demo video posted at \newline  \textcolor{blue}{\url{http://isse.sourceforge.net/index.html}}. 
\item Open the application and start a new project via: File $\rightarrow$ New. 
\item Select a short (5-30 second) .wav file.  Longer files are permitted, but will be slow to process.  If needed, select  one of the example files from the \emph{Test Files} folder of the download package.
\item View and listen to the sound.  Time goes from left to right. Frequency goes from bottom to top. You can zoom, scroll, etc. Click the play button at the top or hit spacebar to listen.
\item Choose which sound you would like to separate (e.g. vocals vs. background music, cell phone ring vs. speech, etc.).
\item Associate one of the two colors from the top left to a given sound (e.g. vocals).  Associate the remaining color for the remaining sound in the recording (e.g. background music).
\item Start annotating the visualization of sound.  Select one of the drawing/painting tools (e.g. brush, time select, frequency select, box select).
Draw on salient regions of the visualization that correspond to each sound source (e.g. drums, bass, vocals, etc).  Use the brush controls (click the plus sign to right of the brush tools) as a measure of confidence. You do not have to annotate the entire file. 
\item Click the process button (upper right). Wait a little bit and the middle and bottom audio tracks will soon display the separated results. When the processing button is on the results will continually update in the background.
\item Listen and view the separated results. They won't be perfect, but...!
\item Repeat the annotation process.   Now draw on the input and output to refine the separation. 
\item Export the separated results via:  File $\rightarrow$ Export Audio and save the project via:  File $\rightarrow$ Save As.  Note, to save, export audio, open, and create new projects, the processing button must be off and the processing progress bar must 100\%.
\item Done!
\end{enumerate}
