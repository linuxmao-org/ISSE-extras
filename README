ISSE - Interactive Sound Source Separation Editor (pronounced 'ice')
 
About: 

ISSE is an interactive sound source separation editor.  It allows you to 
import a single audio recording and separate into two distinct sound sources
via drawing and painting tools.  Example tasks include separating a cell 
phone ring from recorded speech, separating drums mixed with bass guitar, 
or separating vocals from background music. See demo videos for more 
information.
